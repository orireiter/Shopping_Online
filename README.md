# Shopping_Online

made by Ori Reiter
used with python 3.8 (HAVE NOT CHECKED OTHER VERSIONS OF PYTHON)

1)  to run fluently you need to run the 3 apps:
    app.py
    shopping_bag_app.py
    order_sender.py

2)  as of now you need to have mongodb installed locally 
    in the config file you can choose the name of db and collections
    PRODUCT - mongo doc example:
    {
    "_id":{"$oid":"5e78b0994813c62dbc2c1e48"},
    "Number":"1000100030",
    "Barcode":"856591000512",
    "Name":"snack sticks",
    "Price":"â‚ª 10.41"
    }

    user docs will be generated by the web, there's no need to plan that ahead,
    except for specifying a name for the collection in the db (specify that in the config file).

3)  images will be put in static\item_img and will be named barcode.png
    example 1234567891234.png
    keep img same size to make ui better and make sure they're all .png type

    as for the barcode image (those black & white lines), this will be auto generated
    if you specified in the db that item's barcode

4)  in the static folder there an image called no image. that's what'll
    show if the specific product image isnt found, you can the change this by replacing it with a different image
    but keeping the same name. (no_image.png)


5)  few notes:
        1. make sure the email you're using allows less secure apps to use it
        2. check the config file to see what's there
        3. make sure the relevant ports are open (5000,5001,5002),
           i havent put that up to change in the config yet.
        4. module required - pymongo, flask, python-barcode


not implemented yet - auto deletion of past/irrelevant orders, logging to a log file etc...
about to add - when no barcode is found the mail should say so.
